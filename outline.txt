SERVER SIDE
    Table control
    songs table is basically an array with numbered keys and string values
    -addsong
        check to ensure text passed from the chat contains the command we want else do nothing
        adds a song to the end of the queue
        using table.insert( tablename, songstring ) where insert() without the third arguement of for the key always appends to the end of the table
        need to remove the command from the string saved
        later need to ensure link is a youtube link. DO NOT publish addon on workshop without this.
    -removesong
        check to ensure text passed from the chat contains the command we want else do nothing
        removes the last song entered in the queue using table.remove(tablename, 1)
          note that tables in lua always start from 1
    -getsong
        return the string for a song url given a key.
    
    users table is to keep track of anyone who actually wants to hear the music. Can only rickroll so many
    - includePlayer
        check to ensure text passed from the chat contains the command we want else do nothing
        use the Player class functions to grab the UserID and insert that in the players table
    - removePlayer
        check to ensure text passed from the chat contains the command we want else do nothing
        use the Player class functions to grab the UserID and search the players table for it
            use a for loop to iterate through the table unless a better way is found
        if player is found, delete the key from the table using table.remove(tablename, key)
        if no player is found, print message to console(or chat in final version) that the player has not opted in

    Chat Hooks
        hook.Add("PlayerSay", "uniqueeventname", functiontocall); is a useful way to check the chat for commands if you don't want to create a whole ingame interface and keep things simple
        Need a hook for each command. Have to keep each command phrase unique so not easy to say by accident
        TO CONSIDER - figure out how to open in-game browser via command or add in functional menu or send chat message to players to use steam overlay browser to find songs

        Commands
            !addsong url
            !removesong
            !joinradio
            !leaveradio
            !play
            !stop

    PLayback
        playSong
            TODO
            iterate through user table in a loop send them the url of the current song in the loop
            find way to check if play back has ended
                remove song from queue and play the next at top of the queue. send every song url out each time
        stopSong
            TODO
            send signal to all users in user table to stop playing

        Client-Server communication done through Net library https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Net_Library_Usage
        TODO - figure out how this works and test


//OLDER VERSION BEYOND THIS POINT//
//plan outline here

 - need to make a socket serverside clients all access to get website urls. Limit to youtube to start
 - gmod has functions for playing music from urls
 - client version only needs to connect to socket and if changes detected play song/change song/stop playing
 
 Should Server be able to notify clients of a socket update or do clients need to check? 
 Should stopping the song delete the url as well? Possibly consider pause function
 
 Functions wanted:
  Chat Commands:
  - set song
  - stop playing
  
  //consider these later
  - queue song
  - remove from queue
  - mute song (client only)
  
 Server Side Structure:
  - create socket to hold urls as lines of text
      one url per line
  - allow input to socket from connected clients
  - to start, only one line. New song url can overwrite old url instead of appending
  
  //consider later
  - close socket when no clients
  - deleted played songs once done
  
 
 Client Side Structure:
  - connect to server socket on server join
  - grab url on top line and use play command (gmod has this command just need to execute it at the right time)
  - stop song signalled to socket
  - add song to socket
