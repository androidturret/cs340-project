//plan outline here

 - need to make a socket serverside clients all access to get website urls. Limit to youtube to start
 - gmod has functions for playing music from urls
 - client version only needs to connect to socket and if changes detected play song/change song/stop playing
 
 Should Server be able to notify clients of a socket update or do clients need to check? 
 Should stopping the song delete the url as well? Possibly consider pause function
 
 Functions wanted:
  Chat Commands:
  - set song
  - stop playing
  
  //consider these later
  - queue song
  - remove from queue
  - mute song (client only)
  
 Server Side Structure:
  - create socket to hold urls as lines of text
      one url per line
  - allow input to socket from connected clients
  - to start, only one line. New song url can overwrite old url instead of appending
  
  //consider later
  - close socket when no clients
  - deleted played songs once done
  
 
 Client Side Structure:
  - connect to server socket on server join
  - grab url on top line and use play command (gmod has this command just need to execute it at the right time)
  - stop song signalled to socket
  - add song to socket
